The package is intended to be used together with the Senior Car's perception model.

### Dependencies
- [ ] itolab_senior_car_msgs

### Notes

- Set the region information in `param/regions.csv`.
- The is no logging available, thus, if all you nodes terminated when you already halfway in the test run, you need to restart at the initial position. (This will be update in future release).
- Example on how to arrange the library is available in `test`.
